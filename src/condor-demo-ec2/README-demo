The 2HTY_A receptor is docked against each of the available ligands from the NCI diversity db. 
We use here only 457 ligands.  The preparation step of creating pdbqt files, and grid map files 
was run on a different machine and results collected.  The actual time for each run is variable and
much longer then the demo time.  
For the demo, we use hte autodock4 program that dock receptor and a ligand. Each docking is a condor job.

Step by step:

Step 1: prep jobs making pdbqt files, grid maps, etc - run on a separate machine.  Get the files needed for the docking.
Step 2: to install on EC2 machine:
  (1) bio roll  (need autodock4 program)
  (2) NCIdiversity.tar.gz - database of ligands. This will be used by autodock4 program
          mkdir -p /share/apps/db
          gunzip -c NCIdiversity.tar.gz | ( cd /share/apps/db; tar xvf -)

Step 3: to install in user account on a frontend (condor master) for runnign the demo:
  (1) install the database od ligands as in Step 2, Choose the same dir. 
  (2) 2HTY_A-demo.tar.gz - demo files and scripts
          tar xvf 2HTY_A-demo.tar.gz
      This results in: 2HTY_A/ prepJob.sh  run_adt.sh
      2HTY_A/ - directory of map files and description files that resulted from running autogrid program
                This was a  set of files that resulted from Step 1 (ru elsewhere) 
      prepJob.sh - a script that creates a condor submit file and needed links (this is for naming convention for ligands)
      run_adt.sh - a scipt that will be executed as a condor job

   (3) Create all needed files: 
          ./prepJob.sh 2HTY_A 2HTY_A/dpfs
   (4) submit condor job
          condor_submit 2HTY_A.sub 
       The resulting docking files are collected in the directory where condor job was run, and the
       logs/output will be written in logs-2HTY_A/

NOTE: if the database installation directory is changed, adjust DBDIR variable in run_adt.sh.
