The Condor Roll is added to a Frontend installation in exactly the same

Once the Condor Roll is loaded the installer will continue installation
automatically with no further user input. The Frontend will be configured as 
a condor pool manager and a submit node. Nodes of appliance type "compute" will 
will be configured as submit/execute nodes.

Other appliances can be made part of the execution pool through setting an appliance attribute and reinstalling those nodes.
