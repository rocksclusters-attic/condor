The Condor Roll must be installed during the Frontend installation step
of your cluster (refer to section 1.2 of the Rocks usersguide).
Future releases will allow the installation of the Condor Roll onto a
running system.

The Condor Roll is added to a Frontend installation in exactly the same
manner as the required HPC Roll. Simply select the Condor roll as you would 
any network- or CD-based roll.

Once the Condor Roll is loaded the installer will continue installation
automatically with no further user input. The Frontend will be configured as 
a condor pool manager and a submit node. The rest of
the machines in the cluster will be configured as submit/execute nodes.
